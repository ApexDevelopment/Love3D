# Love3D Engine
A 3D renderer written entirely in Lua.

## About
This is based on javid9x/OneLoneCoder's 3D renderer, which he wrote for his olcConsoleGameEngine and documented on his YouTube channel.
I followed along with his videos in 2019, then returned in 2023 to fix it up and get it fully working.
It is not very performant. It was mainly a learning exercise in graphics programming for me.
